# RemoteOS FRP integration — current implementation boundary

This document records the code-level V1 boundary implemented from the FRP integration Goal. It does not change the architecture or security constraints in the Goal document.

## Implemented control plane

- `Shared/RemoteOS.Protocol/Tunnels` owns the JSON contract and route constants. Safe profile responses expose only `tokenConfigured`; they never contain a token, generated TOML, or protected-secret payload.
- The Server persists FRP server profiles and tunnel desired state in SQLite, scoped to the JWT subject, with optimistic revision checks and unique remote-port constraints. Runtime/process state remains host-local and is not a Workspace preference.
- Tokens enter only through `PUT /api/v1/tunnels/profiles/{id}/secret`, are protected with ASP.NET Core Data Protection, and are read only while a private `frpc.toml` is generated. There is no read, list, export, or configuration-download endpoint for secrets.
- `TunnelsRead` permits Controller and Observer sessions to read safe state; `TunnelsManage` requires a Controller session. The policies recognize both raw JWT `role` and the framework-mapped role claim, while never trusting a client app id. Profile, tunnel, and token mutations write sanitized audit records without request bodies or TOML.
- External Runtime detection accepts only a canonical absolute file path, checks existence and executable status, and invokes only `<fixed-path> --version` through `ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList`. It never modifies, starts, upgrades, or kills an external executable while detecting it.
- Applying a profile serializes work per profile, writes a private temporary TOML, invokes only `<fixed-path> verify -c <fixed-temp-path>`, then replaces the managed configuration and starts a RemoteOS-owned `frpc` child process using an argument list. A failed verification or start returns a stable problem code and keeps/restores the previous configuration. Stop uses the stored process object plus PID/start-time check; it does not search for or kill processes by name.

## Supported configuration surface

Only `tcp`, `udp`, `http`, and `https` desired state is accepted. The generator has a closed schema: server host/port, token authentication, TLS enablement, local host/port, remote port/domain, and per-proxy transport compression/encryption. It emits no `includes`, plugins, environment substitution, arbitrary TOML, arbitrary command arguments, OIDC, STCP, XTCP, visitor, or `frps` settings.

## Runtime trust and release operations

Managed Runtime installation is an explicit Controller-only action (`POST /api/v1/tunnels/runtime/managed/install`) requiring a confirmation and a requested **pinned** version. The server accepts a release only when its host-admin configuration supplies the current RID, an HTTPS official GitHub release URL, a fixed 64-character SHA-256 and a recognized archive format. It never has a “latest” route.

The install pipeline downloads to a private temporary file with a bounded stream, verifies the SHA-256 before extraction, rejects path traversal, symlink/device entries, oversized entries and unexpected archive contents, extracts only `frpc` / `frps`, checks `frpc --version`, and then activates the new version by atomically replacing a private `state.json` pointer. Previous versions remain in distinct version directories; rollback verifies the previous `frpc` again before switching the pointer. Failed downloads, checksums, extraction and health checks cannot replace the active version.

The shipped `appsettings.json` freezes FRP `v0.71.0` Linux x64 and arm64 assets with values copied from the official release. Windows release entries must be added by the signed host deployment only after the corresponding official per-asset SHA-256 has been independently reviewed; without such an entry Windows returns `tunnel.runtime_release_not_configured` rather than downloading an unverified binary.

The Server verification suite uses a local `tar.gz` fixture and replaceable HTTP client to cover successful installation, active/previous switching, rollback, wrong checksum rejection, unexpected archive-content rejection, and Desired State → `frpc verify` → process start/stop. It does not require a network download or a locally installed FRP binary.

FRP's official configuration reference documents `frpc verify -c <config>` as the validation contract used here. The official release page publishes per-asset SHA-256 values; a release manifest must copy those values before any managed installer is exposed. Current upstream compatibility and lifecycle information must be revalidated during that work; do not infer a version from this document.

## Operations

Private generated files are under `data/tunnels/frp/<profile-id>` below the Server content root; Unix modes are tightened to `0700` for the directory and `0600` for TOML and backup files. Runtime versions and their state pointer are likewise private. Windows uses the service account's data directory and must be deployed with an ACL granting only that account access. Defender is never modified. A quarantined or missing Runtime is reported as unavailable; RemoteOS authentication and LAN APIs have no FRP dependency. Runtime stdout/stderr is drained, bounded to 200 sanitized lines per profile, and a dedicated read endpoint never returns generated configuration or credentials. The state transitions to `Connected` only after FRP reports a successful server login; recognized authentication failures are shown as disconnected rather than a synthetic healthy state.
